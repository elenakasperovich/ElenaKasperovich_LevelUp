I kept the love you gave me alive, and now I carry it with me,
I know it's just a tear drop from mother earth, but in it
I can hear a dolphin sing,
Telling me I'll never be alone, I know you're right there...
So with the fire still burning bright, I wanna gaze into your light,
If I could see my fortune there, you know how flames can hypnotize...
Do I even dare to speak out your name,
for fear it sounds like, like a lover

So don't cry for your love, cry tears of joy,
Cos you're alive cradled in love.
